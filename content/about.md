## Hi, I'm Nitishkumar Harsoor 👋

I'm a **Data Scientist** at Fidelity Investments specializing in GenAI and recommender systems. With over 12 years of experience in technology and 5+ years focused on AI/ML, I build enterprise-grade solutions that deliver measurable business impact—from $32M annual cost savings through GenAI pipelines to $197M+ in quarterly impact from recommender platforms.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### Data Scientist
**Fidelity Investments** | Bangalore, India | *October 2022 - Present*

- **Led AgentBot 3.0 development**: Built an enterprise scalable LLM evaluation pipeline where LLM-extracted structured JSON from call transcripts powered downstream pre-call insights, in-call assistance, and post-call rep note/email generation
- Developed the **Workplace Seminar Recommendation System** for over 15 million participants using two stage architecture utilizing LightGBM and
neural network, delivering a **2.3× lift in event attendance**.
- **Deployed Helios Collections recommender** to production using LinGreedy contextual multi-armed bandits, modeling each collection as an arm and learning context-aware rewards via ridge regression, resulting in a **2.13× lift in CTR@1** over the baseline in the Helios mobile app
- **Fine-tuned T5 transformer models** for email summarization on noisy email chains, combining regex-based parsing and embedding-driven noise filtering to isolate salient content and improve summary quality
- **Implemented model interpretability and fairness evaluation** for every recommender system using SHAP and Jurity libraries, improving transparency, reliability, and bias detection
- **Built an end-to-end voice agent pipeline**—covering speech-to-text, turn detection, LLM-based tool calling, and text-to-speech—as part of a Fidelity GenAI hackathon initiative

### Lead Systems Analyst
**Fidelity Investments** | Bangalore, India | *April 2021 - October 2022*

- Built a **retrieval-and-re-ranker–based neural search engine** for the Gurubar tech support app, enabling associates to self-resolve laptop issues and **reducing ticket volume by ~40%** through relevant KB article recommendations
- Built **enterprise-grade ML systems** including a holiday incident classifier and BERT-based clustering engine, automating manual ticket review and achieving **90%+ accuracy** in identifying repeated incidents during peak periods
- Developed **ML-driven ticket routing models** (XGBoost + BERT NLP) that achieved **85%+ assignment accuracy**, reducing MTTR by routing tickets to correct teams automatically
- **Architected and deployed to production Data Intelligence Platform** serving **720+ users**, implementing Dockerized infrastructure, NGINX load handling concurrent connections, and enterprise-grade SSO/SSL security

### Software Engineer
**Fidelity Investments** | Bangalore, India | *April 2016 - April 2021*

- Worked on the **Purchase and Sales (P&S) application**, a trade processing system that captures trade data from multiple feeds such as order-entry systems, validates and processes trades, and delivers formatted transactions to back-office systems
- Managed trade exceptions, supported reprocessing of failed transactions, and provided functionality to cancel or correct trades

### System Engineer
**IBM** | Bangalore, India | *April 2013 - April 2016*

- Worked on **Universal Payment System (UPS)** application, supporting large-scale cheque issuance, ACH payments, and generation of EOP/EOB statements for healthcare providers and members
- Contributed to IBM's hybrid cloud and AI solutions portfolio

## 🚀 Key Projects

### AgentBot 3.0 - Contact Centre Automation with GenAI
*October 2025*

Streamlined contact centre associate tasks and routines by automating experiences at different stages of the call (pre-call, during, after) using state-of-the-art LLM models.

- Designed a **two-stage GenAI pipeline** where structured JSON extraction served as a data foundation for downstream rep note, email, and pre-call insight generation
- Built an **LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework** with attribute-level precision/recall, missing vs incorrect signals, and model leaderboards for systematic comparison
- Built a **production-grade LLM validation platform** using Streamlit for validating **150+ extracted attributes across 2,000+ calls**, enabling hallucination detection, missing-field analysis, real-time dashboards, and automated prompt optimization
- Leveraged **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** to extract **150+ structured attributes** from call transcripts, enforcing output correctness through **Pydantic-based JSON schema validation**

### Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit Recommender for Investment Collections
*September 2024*

Personalized the Collections component in the Helios mobile app to increase customer engagement, where each collection represents an investment idea composed of thematically similar underlying products.

- Implemented a **LinGreedy contextual multi-armed bandit**, modeling each investment collection as an arm with **per-arm ridge regression**
- Utilized **Mab2Rec library** to evaluate linear policies from MABWiser and benchmarked these against non-contextual random policies
- Achieved **2.13× lift in CTR@1** compared to baseline

### Workplace Seminar Recommendation
*November 2023*

Identified the most relevant seminar topics for each participant and aggregated recommendations at the plan-sponsor level, enabling targeted and personalized communication campaigns.

- Designed **two-stage modeling approach**: Stage 1 predicts likelihood of attending any seminar; Stage 2 predicts likelihood of attending a particular theme
- Implemented a **LightGBM binary classifier** for Stage 1 and a **neural network–based multi-label classifier** for Stage 2
- Trained on **two years of historical attendance data** and validated on out-of-time datasets with consistent performance
